# Tensor Train Decomposition for Compression â€“ A Practical Example in Xerus
This repository provides an example of tensor train (TT) decomposition using the [Xerus](https://libxerus.org/) library, demonstrating its effectiveness in compressing high-order tensors.

## Objective
Higher-order tensors present significant computational challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, leading to high storage requirements and expensive computations. Developing efficient compression techniques is crucial for handling such large-scale data.

In their work, Ballard, Kolda, and Lindstrom use the [Miranda Turbulent Flow Dataset](https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_data_miranda_sim) to illustrate the successful application of Tucker decomposition for tensor compression. This repository aims to showcase how Tensor-Train decomposition can achieve even better performance.

Additionally, we highlight the simplicity and usability of the [Xerus](https://libxerus.org/) library, which offers efficient tensor computation tools, with strong support for Tensor-Train format and general tensor networks.

## The dataset
The [Miranda Turbulent Flow Dataset](https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_data_miranda_sim) represents a Rayleigh-Taylor instability simulation, where two fluids of different densities accelerate against each other, leading to turbulent mixing. The dataset captures a late-stage time step of this instability, computed using the Miranda software from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and is published by the [Scientific data reduction benchmark (SDRBench)](https://sdrbench.github.io). We utilize the pre-processed subtensor from Ballard et al. with dimensions `2048 x 256 x 256`.

## Files
* `density.mat` - Input MATLAB file, uploaded with Git LFS.
* `Miranda.cpp` - C++ implementation for computing the Tensor-Train compressions. Requires [Xerus](https://libxerus.org/building_xerus/), [Matio](https://github.com/tbeu/matio/tree/master) (available on Ubuntu via `sudo apt install libmatio-dev`) and at least 7+ GB of RAM.
* `xerusTensors/` - Contains the uncompressed Xerus tensor and Tensor-Train tensor.
* `compressionResults/` - Stores the MAT files of the compressed tensors, generated for different thresholds `1e-x`.
* `visualization/` - Includes the Python script for 3D visualization and the resulting PNG image.

## Result
We first computed the full-rank Tensor-Train decomposition and then used the Xerus round() function to compress the tensor to the desired threshold. While this function will find a sufficient approximation, it does not necessarily yield the best estimate. In accordance with Ballard et al., we used the squared error in Frobenius norm ($||X - T||_F^2 / ||X||_F^2$).

Our results show that even for a relative error of 1e-8, the Tensor-Train approximation takes less than 4% of the original storage size. The [Tucker decomposition](https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_data_miranda_sim/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads#computing-tucker-and-visualization-of-compressed-results) was only evaluated up to a threshold of 1e-4 and for these values the comparison reveals 10 to 100 times better compression ratios for the TT decomposition.

In our visualization, we show the results of the first five compressions together with the original tensor.
